            My name is Kevin Rosengren and I am a born and raised Texan. I currently live in Austin, Texas. I used to attend and play baseball for Trinity University,
            but was not passionate about any of the career paths that I was on there. I am now enrolled in the University of Texas full stack Web Developement
            bootcamp and have really enjoyed and immersed myself in the course. So far, I am fluent in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and am eager to keep learning. I love
            to learn and aqcuire new skills and have many other hobbies which include any sport, learning and playing musical instruments, and taking my board to the beach
            whenever I can to catch some waves. I am determined and excited to make web developement and coding a career.
